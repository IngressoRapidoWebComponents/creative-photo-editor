![alt Editor](demo/editor.png)

![alt Editor 2](demo/editor2.png)

It's simple:
```html
    <img id="imageDisplay" src="image.jpg">
    <creative-photo-editor
        id="example"
        api-key="1234567"
        image="imageDisplay">
    </creative-photo-editor>
```

After that, create an editor:
```js
    this.$.example.create();
```
